# Content Visibility Specific Users Add-On

Do you need to show or hide some of your content blocks to one or more users? The specific users add-on for Content Visibility lets you do just that.

Want to leave yourself a note that only you should see? You got it.
Want to show a form for one specific person to only they can fill it in? Yup.
Hide or show any block for any specific user or users.

## Content Visibility

Works alongside the core [Content Visibility plugin](https://github.com/richardtape/content-visibility) and [Date and Time add-on](https://github.com/richardtape/content-visibility-date-and-time) meaning you can schedule blocks for dates and times and only shown them to those users signed in with a specific role from a specific country!
