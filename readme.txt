A Specific Users add-on for [Content Visibility](https://wordpress.org/plugins/content-visibility/).

== Description ==

Do you need to show or hide some of your content blocks to one or more users? The specific users add-on for Content Visibility lets you do just that.

Want to preview a change on an already-live page that only you can see? Make the new block only shown to you and the old block NOT shown to you.
Does your colleague need to see a change before it's approved? Uh huh!
Want to leave yourself a note that only you should see? You got it.
Want to show a form for one specific person so only they can fill it in? Yup.
Hide or show any block for any specific user or users.

## Development

Development is mostly done on [github](https://github.com/richardtape/content-visibility-specific-users/issues/new) and releases are made there and here to the WordPress plugins directory.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What's with the logo? =

It's a chameleon. A cool little creature which can change the way it appears - to make itself more or less visible. Seemed appropriate! Also, your suspicions are correct; a designer, I am not.
